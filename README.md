# HousePrice_prediction
Bharat Internship Machine Learning Task 1

## about Task  ##
In this machine learning project, we leverage linear regression to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant attributes. By training the model on a dataset containing labeled house data, we establish a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable, enabling us to make accurate price predictions for new properties. The linear regression algorithm proves to be a valuable tool for real estate professionals and prospective buyers, providing insights into property valuation and market trends.
